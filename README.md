## üìñ Project Overview

`Shadow-Login-ESP` turns an inexpensive ESP8266 module into a controlled environment for studying captive portal security. It mimics the behavior of public WiFi login pages to provide hands-on experience in both offensive security techniques and defensive recognition.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Captive Portal Activation:** Automatically intercepts web requests, redirecting users to a custom login portal, just like public hotspots.
*   **Credential Harvesting Simulation:** Demonstrates how credentials can be captured in an isolated, offline environment (no data is transmitted externally).
*   **Local Data Storage:** All captured data is stored locally on the device's filesystem for analysis and is wiped upon reset.
*   **Admin Management Interface:** A simple, password-protected web interface to view and manage demonstration data.
*   **OTP/2FA Simulation:** Includes a multi-step login process to teach about complex authentication flows.
*   **Self-Contained & Offline:** The entire system operates independently, with no internet connection or data exfiltration capabilities, ensuring it is safe for lab use.

## üéØ Educational Value

This project is an invaluable resource for understanding:
*   The mechanics of **captive portals** and **DNS redirection**.
*   The risks associated with connecting to **untrusted public WiFi**.
*   **Social engineering** tactics used in phishing attacks.
*   **Defensive strategies** to identify and avoid malicious networks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Requirements

*   ESP8266 Module (NodeMCU, Wemos D1 Mini, etc.)
*   Micro-USB Cable
*   A Computer (for programming and access to the admin panel)

## üîß Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Open the source code** in Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
3.  **Install the required libraries** (ESP8266WiFi, DNSServer, ESP8266WebServer, LittleFS).
4.  **Upload the code** to your ESP8266 board.
5.  **Power the board** and connect to its WiFi network to begin the demonstration.
